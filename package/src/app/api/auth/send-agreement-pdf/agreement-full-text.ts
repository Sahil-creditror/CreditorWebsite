By signing this agreement, Client certifies that he/she is at least 18 years of age, that the information he/she has provided to TSC is true and complete, that he/she is legally authorized to enter into this agreement and authorize the actions of TSC as set forth herein, and that he/she will not use any of the products of TSC or any information provided by TSC for any unlawful or deceptive purpose.",

    title: "DEFINITION OF TRADELINE",
    content:
      "The term \"tradeline\" refers to the line-item for a credit account on a credit bureau report. As used throughout this agreement the term refers to a line of revolving credit, such as a credit card, which forms the basis of the credit bureau report. Client will be added as an \"Authorized User\" onto the purchased line of credit, resulting in the tradeline also appearing on Client's credit bureau report.",

    title: "TRADELINE PRODUCT",
    content:
      "TSC agrees to use its best efforts to perform all functions necessary to have Client added as an \"Authorized User\" to the tradelines he/she selected to report to his/her credit report by the last day in the advertised Reporting Period. It is understood and agreed by both parties that Client will maintain \"Authorized User\" status on those tradelines for two (2) billing/posting cycles for each tradeline after being added thereto, after which he/she will be removed therefrom. Accordingly, it is the understanding and intent of the parties that Client will receive two consecutive postings of each tradeline to his/her credit bureau report and this \"Authorized User\" status shall be reported by two (2) or more credit bureaus. The parties further understand and agree that Client will only be added to tradelines with the full advance knowledge, consent and participation of the primary account holder of the account to which that tradeline pertains. TSC shall coordinate with the primary account holder of the account(s) (\"TSC Credit Sponsors\") to ensure the Client is added as an authorized user. While TSC does not have direct control over such, TSC Credit Sponsors are expected to maintain low balances on their accounts (15% or less of the total credit limit) while a client is an active authorized user and they are expected to keep their accounts in good standing with on time payments. Highest balance may report on the tradeline as a historic factor, which may be above 15% of the credit line, and Client understands this is entirely separate from the current utilization. Tradelines in which Client has been added to may exhibit historical disputed or similar comments. Client understands and accepts the absence of late payments is presumed to be proof of on-time payments as it relates to any given tradeline.",

Client understands and agrees that this fee is to be paid in full prior to the delivery of tradeline product. Client understands and agrees that the tradeline order will not be processed until TSC has received the entire fee, and that all fee payments received are to be considered earned upon receipt and non-refundable, unless a non-posting or non performance by TSC occurs. Client further agrees that in the event any method of payment is returned or declined for any reason, TSC may remove that Client from any tradeline to which that Client has been added and cancel the order.",

TSC is not a credit repair company; it does not directly or indirectly submit disputes or any other correspondence whatsoever to any credit bureaus or creditors on behalf of the Client or anyone else, and it does not make any claims related to the improvement of the Client's credit score, record or history, or anyone else's credit score, record or history.
